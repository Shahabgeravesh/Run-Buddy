### Code Refactoring and Design Enhancement 

Given the Run-Buddy website our focus was:

* To replace the css floats with flexbox to create more fluid layout. 

* Applied media queries to accommodate multiple screen sizes and devices.

* Enhanced the visuals of the webpage with advanced CSS tricks such as pseudo-classes.

Overall, the Run Buddy redesign gave me the opportunity to apply cutting-edge techniques and keep my skills relevant in a mobile-first world. 

### Technology Used
